            <p>If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be "portable", i.e. delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance — provided that this is technically feasible.</p>
            <p><b>The right to request the deletion of your personal information</b></p>
            <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this Application, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).</p>

            <p>However, if you refuse to provide your personal information to us or ask us to delete or stop selling your personal information, and that personal information or sale is necessary for us to provide you with goods or services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.</p>

            <p>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.</p>
            <p>For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:</p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
            <li style="mso-list: l18 level1 lfo48; tab-stops: list .5in;">provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>
            <li style="mso-list: l18 level1 lfo48; tab-stops: list .5in;">describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.</p>
            <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will use any personal information collected from you in connection with the verification of your request solely for the purposes of verification and shall not further disclose the personal information, retain it longer than necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.</p>
            <p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>
            <p>If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a child under your parental authority.</p>
            <p>You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.</p>
            <p><b>How and when we are expected to handle your request</b></p>
            <p>We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your request.</p>
            <p>We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.</p>
            <p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period. Only with regard to personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022, you have the right to request that we disclose information beyond the 12-month period, and we will provide them to you unless doing so proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.</p>
            <p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>
            <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.</p>
