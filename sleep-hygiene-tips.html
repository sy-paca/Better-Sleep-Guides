                        <p>Sleep hygiene refers to the habits and practices that set you up for quality sleep. Good sleep hygiene is not about perfection—it is about creating an environment and routine that supports your body's natural sleep process.</p>

                        <h2>Keep a Consistent Sleep Schedule</h2>
                        <p>Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, helps regulate your body's internal clock. Your brain learns when to release sleep hormones and when to wake up naturally.</p>

                        <h2>Create a Sleep-Friendly Environment</h2>
                        <p>Your bedroom should be cool, dark, and quiet. Aim for a temperature around 65 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Use blackout curtains or a sleep mask to block light, and consider earplugs or a white noise machine if noise is an issue.</p>

                        <p>Caffeine can stay in your system for up to eight hours, so avoid it in the afternoon and evening. While alcohol might make you feel sleepy initially, it disrupts your sleep cycle later in the night.</p>

                        <p>Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep. However, try to finish intense workouts at least a few hours before bedtime, as exercise can be energizing.</p>

                        <p>Stress and worry can keep your mind racing at night. Try journaling, meditation, or gentle stretching before bed to help your mind unwind. Write down your worries so your brain does not have to hold onto them.</p>
