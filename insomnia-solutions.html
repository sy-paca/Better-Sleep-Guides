                        <p>Insomnia can feel frustrating and isolating, but you are not alone. Many people struggle with falling asleep or staying asleep. The good news is that there are natural solutions that can help without relying on medication.</p>

                        <h2>Practice the 4-7-8 Breathing Technique</h2>
                        <p>This simple breathing exercise can help calm your nervous system. Inhale for four counts, hold for seven counts, and exhale for eight counts. Repeat this cycle four times. It activates your body's relaxation response.</p>

                        <p>Starting from your toes and working up to your head, tense each muscle group for a few seconds, then release. This technique helps you become aware of tension in your body and teaches you how to release it.</p>

                        <p>Instead of counting sheep, try visualizing a peaceful place in detail. Imagine the sounds, smells, and sensations. This redirects your mind away from worries and toward relaxation.</p>

                        <p>If you have been lying awake for more than twenty minutes, get out of bed and do something calming in dim light. Read a book, listen to soft music, or do gentle stretches. Return to bed only when you feel sleepy.</p>
