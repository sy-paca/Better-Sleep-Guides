                                <p>If your brain suddenly becomes very busy the moment your head hits the pillow, you are not alone. The way you spend the last hour before bed has a huge impact on how easily you fall asleep and how rested you feel in the morning.</p>
                                <p>The good news is that you do not need an extreme or complicated routine. A few small, consistent habits can gently tell your body and mind that it is time to rest.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h2>Start with a clear cut off time</h2>
                                <p>Choose a time when your night routine officially begins, ideally about one hour before bed. This is the moment you stop work, homework, and stressful conversations. Think of it as closing the door on the day. Your brain needs this boundary to shift out of problem solving mode.</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <div class="article-section">
                                <h2>Dim the lights</h2>
                                <p>Bright lights signal daytime to your brain. Lowering the lights in your home helps your body start producing melatonin, the hormone that supports sleep. Use lamps instead of overhead lights if you can. Soft, warm lighting makes a bigger difference than most people expect.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h2>Put screens away earlier than you think</h2>
                                <p>Phones, laptops, and TVs keep your mind alert and engaged. Try to put screens away at least thirty minutes before bed. If that feels hard, start with fifteen minutes and build from there. Replace scrolling with something calmer like reading, stretching, or listening to gentle music.</p>

                                <h2>Create a short wind down ritual</h2>
                                <p>Doing the same few things each night trains your brain to associate them with sleep. This could be washing your face, making a cup of herbal tea, or writing a short to do list for tomorrow so your mind does not keep reminding you of tasks. Keep it simple and repeatable.</p>

                                <h2>Let your bedroom feel like a sleep space</h2>
                                <p>Your bed should feel like a cue for rest, not a second office or entertainment zone. Try to avoid working or watching intense shows in bed. When your brain links the bed with sleep, it becomes easier to fall asleep once you lie down.</p>

                                <p>A night routine is not about perfection. It is about sending gentle, consistent signals that the day is ending. Over time, these small steps can help you fall asleep faster and wake up feeling more refreshed.</p>
