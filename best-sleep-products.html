                        <p>Creating the perfect sleep environment starts with the right products. The right sleep accessories can make the difference between tossing and turning and waking up refreshed. Here are the sleep products that actually make a difference.</p>

                        <h2>Weighted Blankets for Deep Pressure</h2>
                        <p>Weighted blankets use deep pressure stimulation to help calm your nervous system. The gentle weight can reduce anxiety and help you fall asleep faster. Look for blankets that are about 10% of your body weight for the best results.</p>

                    <div class="article-section">
                        <h2>Silk Pillowcases for Hair and Skin</h2>
                        <p>Silk pillowcases reduce friction while you sleep, which means less hair breakage and fewer sleep lines on your face. They also stay cooler than cotton, helping regulate your body temperature throughout the night.</p>

                    <div class="article-section">
                        <h2>Sleep Masks for Complete Darkness</h2>
                        <p>A good sleep mask blocks out all light, which is essential for quality sleep. Even small amounts of light can disrupt your sleep cycle. Choose a mask that fits comfortably and doesn't put pressure on your eyes.</p>

                        <h2>White Noise Machines</h2>
                        <p>White noise machines can mask disruptive sounds and create a consistent sleep environment. They're especially helpful if you live in a noisy area or have a partner who snores.</p>

                    <div class="article-section">
                        <h2>Temperature-Regulating Bedding</h2>
                        <p>Your body temperature naturally drops as you fall asleep. Temperature-regulating sheets and comforters help maintain the ideal sleep temperature, preventing you from waking up too hot or too cold.</p>
