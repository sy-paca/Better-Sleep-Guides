                        <p>What you do in the morning sets the tone for your entire day—and your night. Your morning routine directly impacts your sleep quality. Here is how to start your day in a way that supports better sleep.</p>

                        <h2>Get Natural Light First Thing</h2>
                        <p>Exposure to natural light in the morning helps reset your circadian rhythm. Open your curtains as soon as you wake up, or step outside for a few minutes. This signals to your brain that it is daytime and helps regulate when you will feel sleepy at night.</p>

                    <div class="article-section">
                        <h2>Wake Up at the Same Time</h2>
                        <p>Consistency is key. Waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, helps stabilize your sleep-wake cycle. Your body learns when to feel alert and when to feel tired.</p>

                        <h2>Avoid Hitting Snooze</h2>
                        <p>Those extra minutes of fragmented sleep do not help you feel more rested. Instead, they can make you feel groggier. Set your alarm for when you actually need to get up and commit to getting out of bed.</p>

                        <p>Morning movement, even just a short walk or gentle stretching, can boost your energy and help regulate your sleep cycle. Exercise in the morning is linked to better sleep quality at night.</p>
